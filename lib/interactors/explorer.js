// An Explorer provides a means for exploring information. This one is
// a little tricky and not entirely clear. Unlike the other interactions,
// we 'explore' information in the plural sense, rather than the Thing
// sense. In other words, we can manipulate, experience and contextualize
// a Thing, but we explore a plural information space.
