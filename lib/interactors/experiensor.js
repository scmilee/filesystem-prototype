// An Experiensor is whatever is necessary for 'experiencing' a Thing.
// For example, a video player is necessary for experiencing a video.
// Intentionally spelled this way, since 'experiencer' is a person who
// is doing the experiencing. In contrast, the Experiensor is the
// mechanism enabling the experience.
