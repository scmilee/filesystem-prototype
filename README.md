# Rhizome

A proof-of-concept for a new information-centric operating system for humans.

## Installation

First, ensure that all dependencies are met.

### IPFS

TODO: Why? What is ipfs for? Why is it a dependency?

Install [ipfs](https://docs.ipfs.io/guides/guides/install).
Create your ipfs keys: `ipfs init`.
Start the ipfs daemon: `ipfs daemon`.

### Nodejs

The main user interface is written in JavaScript. Install [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/).

Next, clone this repository. `git clone git@github.com:scmilee/rhizome.git`

Install the package dependencies: `npm install`

Run the text-based user interface: `npm run tui`

## Old notes

**IPFS is required since the dameon-ctl tool creates new keys each run.**
TODO ^ what does that mean?
